### Here, We analyze the maximum expenditure categorized by Age using Aggregate function

age_category_freqently_visits <- aggregate(TOTCHG ~ AGE, FUN = sum, data = Hospital_Data)
max(aggregate(Hospital_Data$TOTCHG ~ Hospital_Data$AGE, FUN = sum))

age_category_freqently_visits[which.max(age_category_freqently_visits$TOTCHG),]

## Age Category : '0-1' (Infants) frequently visit the hospital
## with maximum expenditure of '678118', as Histogram shows frequency 
## of Infants (0-1) is >300.

#CONCLUSION:-From the above output we conclude that 640 has the maximum hospitalization (267 out of 500) and also has the highest expenditure cost(437978).

## As can be seen 484 patients out of 499 fall under group 1, showing that the number of observations for 1 category is way higher than others - hence data is skewed. This will only affect the results from linear regression or ANOVA analysis

cor(Hospital_Data$TOTCHG, Hospital_Data$RACE)
## correlation value is too less indicates that there is no relation

Race_Influence <- lm(Hospital_Data$TOTCHG ~ Hospital_Data$RACE)
summary(Race_Influence)

#R- Squared Value is 0.0003299, very less than 0.5
#pValue is 0.69 it is much higher than 0.5
#We can say that race doesn't affect the hospitalization costs

## Analyzing Using ANOVA

Race_Influence_AOV <- aov(TOTCHG ~ RACE, data = Hospital_Data)
Race_Influence_AOV

summary(Race_Influence_AOV)

#The residual variance (deviation from original) (of all other variables) is very high. This implies that there is very little influence from RACE on hospitalization costs
#As can be seen, the degree of freedom (Df) for RACE is 1 and that of residuals is 497 observations
#The F-Value, the test statistic is 0.16 which is much less than 0.5 showing that RACE doesn't affect teh hospitalization cost.
#The Pr(>F), the p_value of 0.69 is high confirming that RACE does not affect hospitalization cost.

summary(Hospital_Data$FEMALE)

#As can be seen here, there is equal distribution of male and female in the group

Age_Gender_Influence_Cost <- lm(TOTCHG ~ AGE + FEMALE, data = Hospital_Data)
summary(Age_Gender_Influence_Cost)

#Since the pValues of AGE is much lesser than 0.05, the ideal statistical significance level, and it also has three stars (***) next to it, it means AGE has the most statitical significance
#Similarly, gender is also less than 0.05.
#Hence, we can conclude that the model is statistically significant

Age_Gender_Race_Inf_lModel <- lm(LOS ~ AGE + FEMALE + RACE, data = Hospital_Data)
Age_Gender_Race_Inf_lModel

summary(Age_Gender_Race_Inf_lModel)

#R - Squared value = 0.007898 (<0.05)
#The p-value is higher than 0.05 for age, gender and race, indicating there is no linear relationship between these variables and length of stay.
#Hence, age, gender and race cannot be used to predict the length of stay of inpatients.

#As it is apparent from the coefficient values, Age, Length of stay (LOS) and patient refined diagnosis related groups(APRDRG) have three stars (***) next to it. So they are the ones with statistical significance
#Also, RACE is the least significant. build a model after removing RACE

# Lets clean the data

comp_analysis_1 <- lm(formula = TOTCHG ~ AGE + LOS, data = Hospital_Data)
summary(comp_analysis_1)

#Removing Race and gender doesn't change the R2 value. It doesn't impact cost
#Removing APRDRG in model comp_analysis_1 decreases the standard error.HENCE comp_analysis holds good.
# So, AGE, LOS, APRDRG collectively influence the hospital price. 

#Analysis Conclusion:
#  As is evident in the multiple models above, health care costs is dependent on age, length of stay and the diagnosis type.
#Healthcare cost is the most for patients in the 0-1 yrs age group category
#Maximum expenditure for 0-1 yr is 678118
#Length of Stay increases the hospital cost
#All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups also affects healthcare costs
#640 diagnosis related group had a max cost of 437978
#Race or gender doesn't have that much impact on hospital cost
